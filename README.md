# roman-numerals
This was a coding challenge as part of a job application a year ago that they think I did well on and got the job. There was a 3-hour time limit. So it isn't perfect, but I knocked out a decent number of edge cases and could confidently finish it with more time, but I like showing it at the state it was in at 3hrs.

The prompt: Please create a program that will convert Roman numerals to Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.) and vice versa. You may do this in any of the following languages: PHP, Python, JavaScript, C++, C# or Java. You may use the IDE of your choice. We ask that you complete as much as you can and that you spend no more than 3 hours on it. If you don’t finish it, just send us what you’ve managed to complete. You’re free to use the internet as a resource, as long as you’re not copying code.  

Your program should receive an input in the form of a Roman numeral or a standard number and convert correctly. Other than that, how you write the program and how it works is entirely up to you. We’re primarily interested in seeing that you have enough of an understanding of the basics of programming to be able to learn everything that we have to teach you so that you can eventually be an asset to our team. Keep that in mind as you code.
